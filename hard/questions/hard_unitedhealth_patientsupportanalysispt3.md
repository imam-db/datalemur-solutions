### Patient Support Analysis (Part 3) [UnitedHealth SQL Interview Question]

[Back to list of hard questions](../README.md)


<a href="https://datalemur.com/questions/patient-call-history">Read the original question page</a>

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

Write a query to get the patients who made a call within 7 days of their previous call. If a patient called more than twice in a span of 7 days, count them as once.

**Explanation**

Only patient 50837000 made another call (on March 12th, 2022) within 7 days of the last call (on March 9th, 2022).

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!


**Solution**

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT policy_holder_id,
  call_received,
  LEAD(call_received) OVER (PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY call_received ASC) AS next_call
FROM callers
)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT policy_holder_id) AS patient_count
FROM cte
WHERE EXTRACT(epoch FROM next_call-call_received) <= 7*3600*24;
```


**Solution Output**

| **patient_count** |
|-------------------|
| 40                |
