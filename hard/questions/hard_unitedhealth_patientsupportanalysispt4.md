<a href="https://datalemur.com/questions/long-calls-growth">Read the original question page</a>

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

A long-call is categorised as any call that lasts more than 5 minutes (300 seconds). What's the month-over-month growth of long-calls?

Output the year, month (both in numerical and chronological order) and growth percentage rounded to 1 decimal place.

| 2022   | 5       | 200.0          |

**Explanation**

Call counts: Jan - 2 calls; Feb - 2 calls; Mar - 3 calls; Apr - 1 call; May - 3 calls

- In January, the percentage is 0% as there is no previous month's call info.
- In February, the percentage is 0% as there is no increase/decrease from January.
- In March, the growth is +50.0% as there is an increase of 1 call from February.
- In April, drop by 66.7% as there is a reduction of 2 calls from March.
- Finally, in May, there were 3 calls thus a 200.0% growth from April.


The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!


**Solution**

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
  SELECT to_char(call_received, 'YYYY') AS yr,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_received) AS mth,
    COUNT(policy_holder_id) AS total
  FROM callers
  WHERE call_duration_secs >= 300
  GROUP BY to_char(call_received, 'YYYY'), 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_received)
  ORDER BY yr, mth
),
next_cte AS
(
  SELECT yr, 
    mth,
    total AS currentval,
    LAG(total) OVER() AS prevval
  FROM cte 
)
SELECT yr,
  mth,
  ROUND((currentval-prevval)::DECIMAL/prevval * 100,1) AS pct
FROM next_cte;
```


**Solution Output**
