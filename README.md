# Daily SQL Solutions

Welcome to my repository of daily solutions to SQL problems! Each day, I will be selecting one problem from [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com?referralCode=s7zSt257) and sharing my solution here. The problems are divided into three categories:

- [**Easy**](./easy/): These problems are suitable for beginners or those who are just getting started with SQL.
- [**Medium**](./medium/): These problems are slightly more challenging and are intended for those with some experience with SQL.
- [**Hard**](./hard/): These problems are more difficult and are intended for those with a strong foundation in SQL.

## Technologies

- SQL

## Usage

To try out a solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory for the solution you want to try out.
3. If the solution includes SQL queries, you can run them using your favorite SQL client or by connecting to your database from the command line.
