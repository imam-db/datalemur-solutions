**Solution**

```sql
WITH period_issued AS
(
SELECT MAKE_DATE(issue_year, issue_month, 1)::DATE AS period,
  card_name,
  SUM(issued_amount) AS total_issued
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY  MAKE_DATE(issue_year, issue_month, 1)::DATE, 
  card_name
)
SELECT card_name,
  MAX(total_issued) - MIN(total_issued) AS difference
FROM period_issued
GROUP BY card_name
ORDER BY MAX(total_issued) - MIN(total_issued) DESC;
```
