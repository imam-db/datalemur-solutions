The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT user_id, 
        EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date)-MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = '2021'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date)-MIN(post_date)) > 0;
```


**Solution Output**

| **user_id** | **days_between** |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| 151652      | 307              |
| 661093      | 206              |
