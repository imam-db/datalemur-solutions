### Who Made Quota? [Oracle SQL Interview Question]

[Back to list of easy questions](../README.md)


<a href="https://datalemur.com/questions/oracle-sales-quota">Read the original question page</a>

As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.

Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

Definitions:

- deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
- quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.

`deals` **Table**:

| **Column Name** | **Type** |
|-----------------|----------|
| employee_id     | integer  |
| deal_size       | integer  |

`deals` **Example Input**:

| **employee_id** | **deal_size** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 101             | 400000        |
| 101             | 300000        |
| 201             | 500000        |
| 301             | 500000        |


`sales_quotas` **Table**:

| **Column Name** | **Type** |
|-----------------|----------|
| employee_id     | integer  |
| quota           | integer  |

`sales_quotas` **Example Input**:

| **employee_id** | **deal_size** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 101             | 500000        |
| 201             | 400000        |
| 301             | 600000        |

**Example Output**:

| **employee_id** | **made_quota** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 101             | yes            |
| 201             | yes            |
| 301             | no             |

**Explanation**

User 101 had $700k in sales, beating their $500k quota. User 201 had $500k in sales, beating their $400k quota. User 301 had $500k in sales, but had a $600k quota, so they didn't hit their goal.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

**Solution**

```sql
WITH qdeals AS
(
SELECT employee_id,
  SUM(deal_size) AS deal_size
FROM deals
GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT d.employee_id,
  CASE WHEN d.deal_size > sq.quota THEN 'yes' else 'no' END AS made_quota
FROM qdeals AS d
INNER JOIN sales_quotas AS sq
ON d.employee_id = sq.employee_id
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

**Solution Output**

| **employee_id** | **made_quota** |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| 1               | yes            |
| 101             | yes            |
| 201             | yes            |
| 301             | no             |
| 405             | no             |
