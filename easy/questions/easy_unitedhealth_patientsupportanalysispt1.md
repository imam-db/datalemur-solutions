**Explanation**

The only caller who made 3 or more calls is member ID 50837000.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

**Solution**

```sql
WITH user_cases
AS
(
SELECT policy_holder_id, 
  COUNT(case_id) AS total_cases
FROM callers
GROUP BY policy_holder_id
HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3
)
SELECT COUNT(policy_holder_id) AS member_count
FROM user_cases;
```

**Solution Output**

| **member_count** |
|:----------------:|
| 76               |
