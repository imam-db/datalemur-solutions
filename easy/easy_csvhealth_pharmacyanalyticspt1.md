### Pharmacy Analytics (Part 1) [CVS Health SQL Interview Question]

CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find the top 3 most profitable drugs sold, and how much profit they made. Assume that there are no ties in the profits. Display the result from the highest to the lowest total profit.

**Definition:**

- cogs stands for Cost of Goods Sold which is the direct cost associated with producing the drug.
- Total Profit = Total Sales - Cost of Goods Sold
